//c++ Overview 
//What is C++?//
//C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.

//Despite being an 80s creation, C++ has been a popular programming language throughout these years.

//C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications and software systems.

//C++ is very close to the hardware making it comparatively easy for programmers to give the instructions
//directly to the system without any intermediary giving programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

//Why should we learn C++/ Features of C++?//
//C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.

//In today's operating systems, GUIs, and embedded systems, C++ is widely used.

//It is one of the most popular programming languages for its object-orientedness.
 //C++ is an object-oriented programming language that gives a clear structure to programs
  //and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.

//With C++, you can develop applications or heavy games that can run on different platforms.

//As C++ is close to other programming languages such as C# and Java, which makes it easy for 
//programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa while it is actually very easy to learn.


//How is it different from C?//
//The syntax of C++ is almost identical to that of C, as C++ was developed as an extension of C.

//In contrast to C, C++ supports classes and objects, while C does not.
