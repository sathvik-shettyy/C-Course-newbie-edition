//Requirements before you start
//To start using C++, you need two things:

//A text editor, like Notepad, or an IDE, like VSCode to act as a platform for you to write C++ code

//A compiler, like GCC to translate the C++ code you have written which is a high-level language into 
//a low-level language that the computer will understand.

//What is an IDE?
//IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. 

//It is nothing more than an enhanced version of a text 
//editor that helps you write more efficient and nicer code. 

//It helps to differentiate different parts of your codes with 
//different colors and notifies you if you are missing some semicolon 
//or bracket at some place by highlighting that area.

 //A lot of IDEs are available, such as DEVC++ or Code Blocks, but we will prefer using VS Code 
 //for this tutorial series.

 //Writing your first code in C++
//Open VSCode. Hereâ€™s the simplest print statement we can start with.

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std:cout << "Helllo World";
    return 0;
}
